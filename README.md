📸 Preview
The website includes:
Full-screen parallax image sections
Informational content sections in between
Centered overlay text with background highlights

⚙️ How It Works
The parallax effect is achieved using:
background-attachment: fixed;
Each parallax section (.pimg1, .pimg2, .pimg3) uses:
background-position: center
background-size: cover
Content sections alternate between light and dark themes for contrast.
